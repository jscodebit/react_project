### How react gained popularity?
The "virtual" browser (vs DOM API) that is friendlier than real browser.
Performance with the virtual browser.
"Just JavaScript" - a very small react API to learn after that the JavaScript skills are what make you a better react developer.
React Native (for the win)
Learning React pays off big time for IOS and Android mobile applications. React Native allows to use same react skills to build native application.
