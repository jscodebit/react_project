## Kick-start
We will build a small web based portal during this workshop. The idea is to get hands-on experience on the basic functionality of the framework, and to apply it to develop a real time application.

### Agenda
- Introduction
- Installation of React Components
- Modern JavaScript
- Rendering Elements
- Components and Props
- State and Lifecycle 
- Handling Events
- Forms
- Demo App : GitHub Card

### How react gained popularity?
The "virtual" browser (vs DOM API) that is friendlier than real browser.
Performance with the virtual browser.

"Just JavaScript" - a very small react API to learn after that the JavaScript skills are what make you a better react developer.

React Native (for the win)
Learning React pays off big time for IOS and Android mobile applications. React Native allows to use same react skills to build native application. 

### Advantages of Developing Modern Web apps with React.js
##### ReactJS has Power-Packed Features
- Component Creation
- Virtual DOM
- Easy to learn
##### Make Your Business “React”-iveNotable Boost In Performance

Seamless SEO Integration: For any online business, content is king. Search Engine Optimization is the gateway to boost user traffic onto their platform. React significantly reduces page load time through faster rendering speed, adapts it performance in real-time based on current user traffic, features that are otherwise not perfectly handled by most frameworks.

##### Ease of Migration
When engineers and managers collaboratively decide upon migrating from an older technological infrastructure to a new one, certain questions arise on the level of effort and time required in performing the task.

##### Quickly Debug Faults
##### Improve Code Stability With Tests

### Some Drawbacks
##### Counterproductive Documentation
The roadblock that developers and product managers are known to face is the limitation of documentation within React.
##### Very UI-centric
Despite being lightweight, React quintessentially is a UI library. There is only so much it can do to enhance performance and robustness of a web app through its core functionalities. Angular and Vue would be considered more extensive with regard to creating full-scale projects unlike React.
